# OffNav
Offline Navigation App for AngelHack Hackathon.

Users tap a button that sends a text message with their location . Location can either be entered manually or captured from the GPS hardware without a data connection. The service then returns directions that are opened up in the application.

All this works because the GPS technology can run whether or not thereâ€™s an active data connection
